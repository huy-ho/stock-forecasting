# Stock Forecasting

I used statistical and modern neural networks techniques to predict a variety of stocks. I also experimented with different architecture styles.
Everything was built from stratch. For example, object classes, data processing, and showcasing results.

Under /results, you can see the true value and predictions of different stocks. 

Libraries used: statsmodels, keras, tensorflow.
