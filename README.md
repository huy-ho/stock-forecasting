# Stock Forecasting

I built everything from stratch. For example, my pre-processed class, data engineering, and results.
I used statistical and modern neural networks techniques to predict a variety of stocks. I also experimented with different architecture styles.

Under /results, you can see the true value and predictions of different stocks. 

Libraries used: statsmodels, keras, tensorflow.
